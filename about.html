				<h3>The Florida "Mountains"</h3>
				<p>In the spring of 2006, on a road trip from Miami to Orlando, I passed by high hills soaring above my head. I didn’t think it was possible, since Florida is one of the flattest states in the country.</p>
				<p>It turns out that hill was the Miami landfill, otherwise known as “Mount Trashmore.” I couldn’t believe one city would create so much waste, let alone the entire state.</p>

			 	<p>Energy is an extremely useful asset in the modern society, but over 50% of that energy is actually wasted. Resource depletion and excessive waste production occurs every second of our lives, and something must be done to stop the potential consequences at hand.</p>

					<p>I started to recycle at home, and took small actions everyday to live a greener lifestyle. I unplugged any electronics I saw that were not being used, timed my showers, and even collected trash to make eco-outfits. My parents weren’t very supportive of my choices, so I had to show them the significance of what I was doing. </p>

					<p>I wanted to take part in environmental projects in my community, but many of them turned me down because I was twelve years old at that time. I decided to take matters into my own hands, and work with my peers to do something about it.</p>

					<p>It was then I created Teens Go Green, a non-profit organization that raises awareness on protecting our environment by following the four R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and our very own R which stands for Respect.</p>

					<p>Teens Go Green has become something larger than I would have ever imagined. Stay tuned on our website to check out all the latest updates and newest upcoming projects. There are many exciting things to come!</p>
